# Twin Tub CMOS Technology
### The twin-tub process, also known as the twin-well process, is a semiconductor fabrication technique used primarily in the production of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits. In this process, two separate wells, or tubs, are created in the silicon substrate to accommodate the n-type and p-type transistors of the CMOS technology.
